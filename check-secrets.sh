# Fails when a Supabase secret key or service-role key is in a file this repository
# tracks or would track. A secret key starts with sb_secret_; a legacy service-role
# key is a JWT whose payload has "role": "service_role". Publishable and anon keys are
# public by design and pass. Every file is read, not a chosen directory, so the count
# is printed with $scope, and a match prints only its file, never the key.
