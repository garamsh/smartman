-- The migration to the 칸 frame (#549, ADR 0137 as amended by ADR 0140) on the shared fixtures,
-- supabase/fixtures/card-frame/conversion.json, which supabase/test-db.sh hands this test as the
-- database setting `smartman.card_frame_fixtures`: each placement converts as its expected list,
-- what it leaves stays, the backup holds every changed row and no client reads it, a second run
-- changes nothing, the revert restores an untouched row exactly and projects an edited one with
-- nothing lost, and the whole runs at production's volume inside what a writer waits for.

-- Each fixture is two cards: card A is left as the migration writes it, card B is edited after.
